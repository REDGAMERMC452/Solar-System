THE SOLOR SYSTEM IS MADE UP OF THE SUN AND EVERYTHINGS THAT ORBITS AROUND IT,
INCLUDING PLANETS ,MOONS, ASTEROIDS ,COMETS AND METEOROIDS. THE SUN IS BY FAR
THE LARGEST OBJECT IN OUR SOLOR SYSTEM. The sun, eight planets, and satellites make up
 the solar system. Asteroids, comets, dust, small planets, and gas are among the other objects 
found in space. The Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars make up the inner solar system, 
whereas the asteroid belt is between Mars and Jupiter’s orbit. According to our knowledge, there
 are around 500 solar systems in the universe. The outer solar system planets are Jupiter, Saturn,
 Uranus, and Neptune. The sun is at the centre of the solar system, and the planets revolve around
 it in their own orbits. The rotation of the planets causes the days and nights, and the changing of 
seasons is caused by the revolution of the planets around the sun. Our solar system exists in the 
Milkyway galaxy. According to scientists and astronomers, the earth is the only planetary body where
 life can exist. But this can be proven wrong after more discoveries about the universe.


<H2 ALIGN=LEFT> THE SUN </H2>
<IMG SRC="The sun.jpg">
<P ALIGN=LEFT> The sun is the largest member of the solor system. all the planets satellites astroides
and comets revolve around it. <br>it is about 150 million KM away from the earth it produces a lot of heat 
and light which is necessary for all form of life on the earth.Life is impossible without the sun. The day can
 never start without the sunrise. It gives us light, and the rays help us synthesise vitamin D, which is 
essential for our body. There are also some harmful rays coming out of the sun called UV rays. Our earth
 is surrounded by an atmosphere that protects us from harmful UV rays. The sun is the star that is at the
 centre of the solar system. Sun is a huge source of heat and light which is essential for the environment.
 The sunlight is also essential for plants to produce food. So life without the sun is impossible. </p>

<h2 align=left> The Earth </h2>
<img src="The earth.jpg">
<P Align=left> The Earth is a planet where the human being live. It is only a planet which has density
to live. It has 71% water and 29% land area. It has its own layer called ozone layer. It protect earth 
from harmeful rays of the sun. Earth is on 3rd position to the Sun.The sphere or spheroid-shaped Earth
 is the third planet in the solar system and is the only life-supporting planet. When seen from the Earth’s
 outer surface, it looks blue in colour due to the presence of water and hence is called the blue planet. 
The Earth provides all its inhabitants with the basic amenities which are required for survival. The sad fact
 is that human beings have been exploiting all the resources which have been made available to us all 
this while mindlessly. If this continues, we will put ourselves and all living things in great danger. It is high
 time we took steps to save our planet. Afforestation, using biodegradable products and reducing pollution
 are some measures you could take to preserve the beauty and quality of life on Earth. </p>  

<h2 align=left> the moon </h2>

<p align=left> A moon is a celestial body that orbits around a planet. 
In other words, it is a natural satellite of the planet. Planets can have any number of moons. 
Some planets like Mercury and Venus have no moon while Saturn boasts a total of 82 moons. 
Earth’s moon is the only natural satellite of our planet. It revolves around the earth in an elliptical
 orbit and takes 27 days to complete one circle. Our moon also rotates on its own axis and takes
 approximately 27 days to complete one rotation as well. We always get to see the same side of 
the moon because having the same rotation and circling period makes it tidally locked to the earth.</p>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT> THE MURCURY </H2>
<img src="Murcury.jpeg">
<P ALIGN=LEFT> THE MURCURY IS THE FIRST PLANET IN ORDER TO SUN. SO THAT 
IT IS THE HOTEST PLANET. IT IS A BLUE PLANET. IT IS ON 2ND IN ORDER TO THE EARTH. IT IS 73 MILLION KILO METER FAR FROM THE EARTH
